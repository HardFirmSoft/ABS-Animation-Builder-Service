<p>AnimaCard-Builder is a fun post-card builder that allows users to drag and drop cute animations onto a backdrop.</p>

<strong><h4>Issue: Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</h4></strong>
The drag and drop feature doesn't work on most browsers, due to security reason caused by Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
A workaround for this issue on Google Chrome is to add "--allow-file-access-from-files" (without quotes) as a parameter for its shortcut.
